# Maze Game

This project is a simple maze game implemented in C++. The game generates a random maze and allows the player to navigate through it to reach the exit. The player uses the 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys to move up, left, down, and right, respectively.

## Features

- Random maze generation
- User-controlled character movement
- Display of the maze with player's current position
- Check for reaching the exit

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Use the following keys to move:
    - 'w' to move up
    - 'a' to move left
    - 's' to move down
    - 'd' to move right
5. Navigate the maze to reach the exit.

## Compilation

To compile the code, you need a C++ compiler. For example, you can use g++:

```sh
g++ -o maze_game maze_game.cpp
